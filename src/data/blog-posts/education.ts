        <p class="mb-4">The crypto space is filled with opportunities, but also with risks. One of the most notorious risks is the "rug pull" - a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run away with investors' funds.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What is a Rug Pull?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">A rug pull occurs when crypto developers create what appears to be a legitimate cryptocurrency project, build community interest and investment, then disappear with the investors' money, leaving them with worthless tokens.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Signs of a Potential Rug Pull</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Anonymous team with no verifiable backgrounds</li>
          <li>Unrealistic promises of returns</li>
          <li>Lack of clear roadmap or whitepaper</li>
          <li>No code audits from reputable security firms</li>
          <li>Limited or locked liquidity</li>

        <p class="mb-4">Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. It is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Key Components of a Blockchain</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Blocks: Each block contains a set of transactions and a reference to the previous block in the chain.</li>
          <li>Nodes: Computers that participate in the blockchain network and validate transactions.</li>
          <li>Consensus Mechanism: A process by which nodes agree on the validity of transactions and update the blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Blockchain Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When a transaction is made on a blockchain, it is broadcast to the network and verified by nodes. Once verified, the transaction is added to a block and included in the blockchain. The block is then added to the chain, and the process repeats.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">This decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and tamper-proof, as any attempt to alter a block would require the consensus of the entire network.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchain networks, enabling trustless and automated transactions without the need for intermediaries.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Smart Contracts?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Think of smart contracts as digital vending machines: you input the required cryptocurrency, and the contract automatically executes the programmed action, whether it's transferring digital assets, issuing tokens, or updating records on the blockchain.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Autonomous Execution: Once deployed, smart contracts operate independently</li>
          <li>Transparency: All terms and transactions are visible on the blockchain</li>
          <li>Immutability: Code cannot be changed after deployment</li>
          <li>Deterministic: Same input always produces the same output</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Use Cases</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts power various applications in the blockchain ecosystem:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols</li>
          <li>NFT minting and trading</li>
          <li>Automated market makers</li>
          <li>Governance systems</li>
          <li>Supply chain tracking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Security Considerations</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">While smart contracts offer many advantages, they also come with risks. Common vulnerabilities include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Code bugs and logic errors</li>
          <li>Reentrancy attacks</li>
          <li>Integer overflow/underflow</li>
          <li>Front-running attacks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Best Practices</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">To ensure smart contract security:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Always conduct thorough code audits</li>
          <li>Use proven design patterns</li>
          <li>Implement proper access controls</li>
          <li>Test extensively before deployment</li>
          <li>Consider insurance coverage for high-value contracts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts are revolutionizing how we think about digital agreements and trust in the Web3 ecosystem. However, it's crucial to understand both their potential and limitations to build secure and efficient decentralized applications.</p>
