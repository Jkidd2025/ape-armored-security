          <li>Cold wallets are better for large, long-term holdings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Best Practices</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">For optimal security and convenience, consider these recommendations:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
