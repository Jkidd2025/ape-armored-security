        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchain networks, enabling trustless and automated transactions without the need for intermediaries.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Smart Contracts?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Think of smart contracts as digital vending machines: you input the required cryptocurrency, and the contract automatically executes the programmed action, whether it's transferring digital assets, issuing tokens, or updating records on the blockchain.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Autonomous Execution: Once deployed, smart contracts operate independently</li>
          <li>Transparency: All terms and transactions are visible on the blockchain</li>
          <li>Immutability: Code cannot be changed after deployment</li>
          <li>Deterministic: Same input always produces the same output</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Use Cases</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts power various applications in the blockchain ecosystem:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols</li>
          <li>NFT minting and trading</li>
          <li>Automated market makers</li>
          <li>Governance systems</li>
          <li>Supply chain tracking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Security Considerations</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">While smart contracts offer many advantages, they also come with risks. Common vulnerabilities include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Code bugs and logic errors</li>
          <li>Reentrancy attacks</li>
          <li>Integer overflow/underflow</li>
          <li>Front-running attacks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Best Practices</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">To ensure smart contract security:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Always conduct thorough code audits</li>
          <li>Use proven design patterns</li>
          <li>Implement proper access controls</li>
          <li>Test extensively before deployment</li>
          <li>Consider insurance coverage for high-value contracts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-4">Smart contracts are revolutionizing how we think about digital agreements and trust in the Web3 ecosystem. However, it's crucial to understand both their potential and limitations to build secure and efficient decentralized applications.</p>
