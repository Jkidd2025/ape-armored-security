      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Rug pulls resulting in complete loss of capital</li>
        <li>Pump and dump schemes manipulating token prices</li>
        <li>Smart contract vulnerabilities leading to exploits</li>
        <li>Wallet blacklisting preventing fund access</li>
        <li>Transaction failures resulting in wasted gas fees</li>
      </ul>
