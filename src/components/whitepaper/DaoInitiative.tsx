        ApeArmor is committed to true decentralization through our DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) initiative. This governance structure will empower our community members to actively participate in shaping the future of the project.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7.1 Governance Structure</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The ApeArmor DAO will implement a transparent and fair governance system where token holders can:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Submit proposals for platform improvements and new features</li>
        <li>Vote on critical protocol changes and parameter adjustments</li>
        <li>Participate in treasury management decisions</li>
        <li>Help determine coverage areas and protection policies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7.2 Voting Power</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Voting power within the DAO will be determined by:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Token holdings: ApeArmor token holders receive voting rights proportional to their holdings</li>
        <li>Staking duration: Long-term stakers receive additional voting weight to incentivize commitment</li>
        <li>Active participation: Community members who consistently engage in governance receive reputation bonuses</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7.3 Treasury Management</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The DAO treasury will manage funds for:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Liquidity provisioning to ensure market stability</li>
        <li>Insurance reserves to back protection guarantees</li>
        <li>Development grants to improve the ecosystem</li>
        <li>Community rewards and incentives</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        By transitioning to a DAO model, ApeArmor ensures that the platform evolves according to the collective wisdom of its users while maintaining the security and reliability that our community members expect.
